# üìà Sales Forecasting Project

This project focuses on **time series forecasting** to predict future sales using machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to analyze historical sales data, identify trends and seasonality, and build accurate predictive models.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used contains historical sales data with features such as:

* **Date/Time** (daily, weekly, or monthly sales records)
* **Store/Product details**
* **Sales Volume**
* **Additional features**: promotions, holidays, etc. (if available)

*(Make sure to update this section with the exact dataset link or details if you used Kaggle or another source.)*

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values and outliers.
   * Converted date fields into time-based features (year, month, day, week, etc.).
   * Normalized/standardized data for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Trend and seasonality analysis.
   * Correlation analysis between features and sales.
   * Visualization of sales patterns over time.

3. **Modeling**

   * Implemented multiple forecasting techniques:

     * **Statistical Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA
     * **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost
     * **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM, GRU, or CNN for time series
   * Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement.

4. **Evaluation & Results**

   * Metrics used: **RMSE, MAE, MAPE**
   * Compared different models and selected the best one for forecasting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Libraries**:

  * `numpy`, `pandas` (data manipulation)
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (data visualization)
  * `scikit-learn` (machine learning)

## üìä Results

* Built models that accurately predict future sales trends.
* Visualized **forecast vs. actual sales** over time.
* Deep learning models captured long-term dependencies better than traditional methods.

## üì¶ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting.git
   cd sales-forecasting
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare dataset:

   * Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
   * Update file paths in the notebook if necessary.

4. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Task_7_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* Use **Prophet (Facebook)** for forecasting with holidays/events.
* Implement advanced **transformer-based models** for time series.
* Deploy the model as a web service or dashboard (Streamlit/Flask).
